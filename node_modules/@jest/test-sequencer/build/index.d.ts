 * Such information is used on:
 * TestSequencer.sort(tests: Array<Test>)
 * to sort the order of the provided tests.
 *
 * After the results are collected,
 * TestSequencer.cacheResults(tests: Array<Test>, results: AggregatedResult)

     *
     * If such information is on cache, tests are sorted based on:
     * -> Has it failed during the last run ?
     * Since it's important to provide the most expected feedback as quickly
     * as possible.
     * -> How long it took to run ?
     * Because running long tests first is an effort to minimize worker idle
     * time at the end of a long test run.
     * And if that information is not available they are sorted based on file size
     * since big test files usually take longer to complete.
     *
     * Note that a possible improvement would be to analyse other information
     * from the file other than its size.
